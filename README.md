# Yelp Review Prediction

This project was developed for CSE 881 at Michigan State University by Sam Berndt (berndts2@msu.edu), Ryan Johnson (john3842@msu.edu), and Joe Freedman (freedm28@msu.edu).

Data from: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/

The Yelp Dataset itself was too large to upload to Github, but code can be run if data is downloaded and placed in the dataset directory.
